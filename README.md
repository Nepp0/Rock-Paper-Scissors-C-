# Rock-Paper-Scossors
I decided to develop a game in *C++* without any help online, as a way to test my skills. I chose to create a simple *Rock, Paper, Scissors* game and built it entirely from scratch.

Surprisingly, debugging the CLI-based game proved to be more challenging than implementing the core mechanics. However, the process was a valuable learning experience.

# The Game

The game features a **main menu** where you can choose a game mode or exit. It offers both **Singleplayer** (against the computer) and **Multiplayer** (play with a friend) modes.

Each match consists of **five rounds**, and once the game concludes, youâ€™ll be given the option to **play again or quit**.

Enjoy the game!
